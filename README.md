# IMDb Top 1000 Movies Data Analysis

## Overview
This project involves exploratory data analysis of the IMDb top 1000 movies dataset using Python libraries such as NumPy and pandas. The dataset contains information about the top 1000 movies, including genres, ratings, directors, actors, and earnings. Through thorough analysis and the use of pandas' `groupby()` function, various insights were derived from the dataset.

## Libraries Used
- NumPy
- pandas

## Dataset
The project utilizes the following dataset:
- `imdb-top-1000.csv`: Contains data related to the top 1000 IMDb-rated movies.

## Analysis Highlights
- **Top Earning Genres**: Identified the top 3 genres by total earnings.
- **Highest Rated Genre**: Determined the genre with the highest average IMDb rating.
- **Most Popular Director**: Found the director with the most popularity.
